# ROADMAP — botmaker-studio-api

The running engineering log. `CHANGELOG.md` is the short, per-release answer; this is the detail and the
reasoning.

## Done

### 2026-09-02 — JDK 25 LTS and JavaFX 25 across all eleven repositories

The whole constellation moves from Java 21 to **Java 25 LTS**, and from JavaFX 21 to **25.0.4** — the newest
patch of the matching LTS line, rather than the bare GA the old pin used. `botmaker-pilot` stays on 17: that
is the Android Gradle toolchain and has nothing to do with this.

**The risk was JitPack, and it was settled before anything was touched.** Eight modules publish there and a
bot resolves the SDK from it, so an image without a 25 JDK would have stopped the migration dead — the
documented workaround being an SDKMAN install in `jitpack.yml`'s `before_install`, which is a per-module
thing to maintain forever. It was proved on a throwaway **branch** build of this module (a branch build
resolves as `<branch>-SNAPSHOT`, so no junk tag had to be cut and later lived with): JitPack reported
`Setting java 25.0.2-open as default`, the build succeeded, and the published jar's class-file major version
was **69** — Java 25, where 21 would have been 65. It genuinely compiled at 25 rather than silently at 21.
No `before_install` is needed anywhere.

**`maven.compiler.release` replaces `source`/`target` in all ten poms**, including the one the archetype
generates. The difference is not cosmetic: `source`/`target` compile against whatever JDK is *running*, so on
a maintainer's JDK 26 box a call into a method that exists in 26 and not in 25 compiles clean and throws
`NoSuchMethodError` on a runner pinned to 25. `release` checks against 25's own platform API. It was safe to
switch because nothing here compiles against a JDK-internal API — every `com.sun.*` import in the
constellation is `com.sun.jna`, an ordinary library — and the only `--add-exports`/`--add-opens` are in
Studio's *surefire* `argLine`, which `release` does not police.

What moved, exhaustively: `jitpack.yml` × 8 → `openjdk25`; `maven.compiler.release` → 25 in ten poms;
`javafx.version` → 25.0.4 in five, plus the archetype's literal `javafx-controls` version; `java-version:
'25'` in fifteen workflow steps across eleven repositories, the plugin registry's `validate.yml` among them
(it resolves and runs `botmaker-cli`, so it must not be older than the CLI's bytecode); and the two
`testing/` Docker images, where `java-25-openjdk-devel` and `openjdk-25-jdk` both turned out to exist in
Fedora 43 and Ubuntu 24.04 respectively — so the images keep their bases and needed no backports line or
third-party JDK repository. The Fedora image's `FROM fedora:43` pin is kept but its *reason* is rewritten: it
existed because F44 had dropped `java-21-openjdk`, and that constraint is simply gone now.

**One thing is deliberately not proven yet: japicmp against a 25-compiled baseline.** The plugin loads and
runs on 25, but both baselines (`v0.0.1` here, `v1.2.0` in the SDK) are currently unresolvable — one is the
broken tag, one is unreleased — so `ignoreMissingOldVersion` makes it report and pass without ever parsing a
major-69 class file. Whether japicmp 0.23.1's javassist can read one is answered by the first release with a
working baseline, and the SDK's pom already records the neighbouring fact that its bundled Groovy cannot read
Java 26 class files. Watch that on the next release rather than assuming it.

**Studio's test suite fails 78 tests on this tree and failed exactly the same 78 before it** — verified by
stashing the pom change and re-running: 1001 tests, 78 failures, 6 errors, both times. They are the
fallout of Studio dropping its SDK dependency on 2026-09-02 (`SdkUpgradeServiceTest`, `SplitPointerTest`, the
toolbar's missing Pilot item) and are not this change's. Every other module's suite passes on 25.

### 2026-09-02 — the gate that published nothing, and the baseline that gated nothing

v0.0.1 — this module's first tag ever — produced **no artifact on JitPack at all**, and took
`botmaker-sdk` v1.1.1 down behind it (`Could not find artifact
com.github.LiQiyeDev:botmaker-studio-api:jar:v0.0.1`). Two separate faults, both in the japicmp block.

- **The plugin would not load on JitPack's Maven.** `japicmp-maven-plugin:0.23.1` declares a Maven 3.6.3
  prerequisite and JitPack's builder runs an older one, so the build died with `The plugin ... requires
  Maven version 3.6.3` — and it died at plugin **load**, before any configuration was read, which is why
  the `<skip>` flag the pom already had could never have avoided it. japicmp now lives in an **`api-gate`
  profile** activated by the *absence* of `botmaker.japicmp.skip`, and `jitpack.yml` passes that property.
  `mvn verify` here and in CI is unchanged.
  - The activation is property-negation rather than `<activeByDefault>` deliberately: Maven cancels every
    `activeByDefault` profile as soon as any profile is named on the command line, so a build that named
    an unrelated profile would silently lose the gate. (`botmaker-sdk` has a `pilot` profile and would
    have hit exactly that.)
  - Skipping it on JitPack costs nothing real, and the reasoning is the one `-DskipTests` in that file has
    always used: JitPack builds an artifact **from a tag that already exists**, so a gate there can only
    break the publish — it cannot prevent the change. The refusal that matters is `mvn verify` in this
    repository's CI, before the tag.
- **The baseline named a tag that has never existed.** `botmaker.japicmp.baseline` was `v1.0.0`, a
  placeholder from before the module had a release, and the instruction in `CLAUDE.md` to *"set it to the
  previous tag in every release commit from the first one onward"* was never once carried out. With
  `ignoreMissingOldVersion` — which exists so a first release is not refused for a reason its author cannot
  act on — that is not a strict gate but a no-op reporting success. Worse, `v1.0.0` sorts **above** every
  tag this module will have for a long time. It is `v0.0.1` now, and the umbrella's `release.sh` bumps it
  in each release commit (`bump_japicmp_baseline`), never backwards.

### 2026-08-31 — a run of slots, and a picture for a declared choice

Two additions, both `default`, both forced by the same editor: the image-template **group** picker, which
the port of the template editors could not carry because its chip row is only partly a slot editor. Its
three callers are the `ImageTemplateGroup.of(…)` slot, an image **varargs** run
(`Matches.hasAny(a, b, c)`) and the `Matches` switch, which narrows the offered set to what the enclosing
find call can produce. Only the first is one argument of one call.

- **`SlotRun`, reached through `SlotContext.run()`** (`null` for a slot that stands alone, which is nearly
  all of them). `elements()` are the run's Java expressions in order; `replace(List<String>, String...)`
  writes the whole run, because an editor that can only write inside its own argument can change an element
  and never add or remove one. `minimum()` and `allowed()` are the host's two narrowings — how few elements
  the surrounding code still compiles with, and the only element sources it will still accept.
- **`allowed()` is element *source*, not decoded values**, and that is the part worth remembering. Studio's
  own narrowing decoded the enclosing group into template paths, which is the host reading a plugin's
  vocabulary out of a plugin's expressions. Listing the arguments of a call is syntactic and needs no such
  knowledge; the plugin decodes them itself. The general rule: when the host has to describe a plugin's
  values, it describes them as the text they are written as.
- **`SlotEditor.preview(ValueContext)`**, `default null` — a small, non-interactive picture of one value,
  for the one place the host *shows* a value without editing it: beside a declared choice. Not a sixth
  contribution surface — it reuses `matches()`, and its default is exactly what a plugin-registered type
  gets today, so nothing is lost by not implementing it. The second `SlotEditor.of` overload takes it.

The host side and the editors that consume both land with the template-editor port; `TestContexts` gained
`withRun` in the same pass, so a plugin author can exercise a run editor — including that a `replace` below
`minimum()` is refused — without a running Studio. Toolkit tests 39 → 45.

### 2026-08-30 — a second plugin interface was built and withdrawn the same day

`CompanionPlugin` — `id`, `displayName`, `toolbarItems`, `projectClosing` — plus `ThemeTokens` and
`StudioServices.themeTokens()`, on the argument that `StudioPlugin` is two interfaces wearing one name: one
for plugins that shape the user's **code**, one for plugins that do something **beside** it. The Remote
Pilot was the case that drew the line, and out of the split came `botmaker-plugin-protocol` (JSON-RPC over
stdio, so a companion could be written in any language) and `ProcessPlugin` in `botmaker-plugin-host`.

**All of it is reverted.** The maintainer's judgement, and it is the right one to record rather than argue:
**the machinery was heavier than the problem it was solving, and the problem was not clearly stated.** One
plugin — the pilot — wanted to be out of process, and answering that took a new module, a new dependency
(LSP4J plus a pinned Gson), a process supervisor, a restart policy, a descriptor format, a wire-record
parallel of four contract records, and a mapping layer to keep them in step by hand. The pilot stays an
**exception attached to the SDK plugin** instead: `SdkPlugin` owns its toolbar item and releases it in
`projectClosing()`, exactly as before.

**What is worth keeping from the exercise, for whoever proposes it again:**

- **Seven of `StudioPlugin`'s eight surfaces already reduce to JSON.** `id`, `displayName`, `catalog`,
  `valueTypes` (a `ValueCodec` is `String`→`String`), `parameters`, `toolbarItems`, `projectClosing`. The
  one that does not is `slotEditors()`, which returns a JavaFX `Node` — and it is exactly the set that
  belongs to shaping code. That audit is still true and is the honest starting point for a second attempt.
- **The line, if it is ever drawn again:** *if it decides what the user's code says it is a `StudioPlugin`;
  otherwise it is a companion; a surface that seems to want both is two surfaces.*
- **Javac states the two-classes rule for you.** Two unrelated interfaces declaring the same `default`
  cannot both be inherited, so a class implementing both must write all of them out.
- **The trigger to watch for is a second plugin, not a better protocol.** The whole cost above was carried
  by one plugin that is already in the SDK's jar and already works. When a plugin exists that *cannot* be
  Java — not merely one that happens to be written in TypeScript — the ledger changes.

The work is in the history if it is wanted: contract `eee3891`, protocol module umbrella `21706a9`, host
`4653064`, Studio `ee33fe5`, SDK `b934aa4`.

### 2026-08-29 — the scaffold surface is deleted: a plugin does not write files

`com.botmaker.plugin.api.scaffold` (`@Scaffold`, `@ClassName`, `@EnumValues`, `@Editable`, `Seeding`),
`catalog.ScaffoldCatalog`/`ScaffoldEntry`/`ScaffoldPlan` and `StudioPlugin.scaffold`/`seedings`, gone whole —
days after they landed, and the reversal is worth more than the surface was.

- **What it did.** A *seed* was a real compiling class in the plugin's own build, marked with what a host may
  substitute, written into a user's project once and thereafter maintained at the marks. Every step of it was
  an improvement on the `SourceEmitter` it replaced: javac checked the seed, the class list was class
  literals, `ScaffoldPlan` validated without a parser, and `Seeding.key` told a rename from a
  delete-plus-create.
- **What was wrong is one level up.** Replacing one code generator with a generalised one made the wrong
  thing a *surface*: any plugin could own files inside somebody's source tree. A file a plugin owns is a file
  its user cannot freely edit, rename or delete — and the ledger, the reconciler and the reference-rewriting
  rename engine the host grew were all cost paid to work around that.
- **The rule now**: a project's structure belongs to the user; a plugin contributes methods a user calls. It
  is the same shape as the `Assets`/`Capture.SourceChoice` reversal two days earlier — *the host owned the
  policy only because it was written first* — and it is stated in `CLAUDE.md` beside that one.
- **What the surface was actually for still has an answer.** An activity's behaviour becomes
  `Activities.define("Mining", ctx -> …)`, written wherever the user likes. What followed as a whole from
  project data was data all along, which was the seed surface's own stated rule and the one its own files
  failed. The compile check a per-activity `Outcome` enum bought is replaced by a host picker on the
  argument — a contribution surface this module already has.
- **Kept from it**: `javax.lang.model.SourceVersion` over a hand-rolled keyword list, and the reminder that
  reflection promises no member order. Both are recorded in `CLAUDE.md`.

### 2026-08-29 — `types()` answers in registration order again

`ValueCatalog` held its registrations in `Map.copyOf`. That produces an immutable map whose iteration order is
unspecified **and randomised per JVM run** — so `types()`, whose own javadoc promises registration order and
which backs every "what type is this variable" dropdown, answered a different order every time Studio started.

- **The symptom is not bug-shaped.** Nobody files "the dropdown is in a different order today"; they conclude
  the application is unreliable. And no single run of anything could show it — it surfaced only from diffing a
  generated `Parameters` file across two builds of the *same* source and getting two different files.
- **It had been true since the vocabulary opened**, i.e. since `ValueType` stopped being an enum. An enum has
  a declaration order for free; a registry has one only if it keeps one.
- An unmodifiable `LinkedHashMap`, with the reason on the field so it is not "simplified" back.
  `typesComeBackInRegistrationOrder` pins three things: one catalog's order, two identically built catalogs
  agreeing (in one run and across runs), and a merge **appending** — installing a second plugin must not
  reorder the first's types.

### 2026-08-29 — the toolbar surface, and the one member that could not be a String

Plugin platform, phase 13a. `ToolbarItem`, `ToolbarGroup`, `EnabledWhen`, `ActionContext` and
`StudioPlugin.toolbarItems()`. The fifth contribution surface, and the first one where the plugin hands over
**data** rather than a `Node`.

- **Why data here and a `Node` for `SlotEditor`.** A bespoke image picker cannot be described as a record; a
  button can. What describing it buys is everything a *shared* bar has to own centrally — the group, the
  order, the separators, the packing, the overflow menu, the icon box, the theme. A surface returning nodes
  would hand all of that to each plugin, and two plugins would produce a bar with two button heights.
- **The label is a `Supplier<String>`, and so is the icon.** This is the one place the sketch was wrong and
  the correction is the useful part: the host's own bar already had a Capture Target button that relabels
  from project state, a Launch Target button that does the same *and* resolves a game's real title and cover
  art on a background thread. A record of `String` would have described a toolbar nobody has. The cost is an
  obligation on the plugin — cheap and pure, called during layout on the FX thread — stated in the javadoc
  where somebody will actually read it.
- **A fourth contributable group, `TOOLS`, was added while porting the host's own bar.** With
  `PROJECT`/`AUTHORING`/`RUN` alone, today's hand-arranged reading order could not be reproduced: the
  instruments (Input, Templates, Overlay, Record, Resources) sit *after* the run cluster. That the four
  groups reproduce the existing sequence exactly was the acceptance test for the port, and it is also the
  argument that the groups are real rather than invented.
- **`ToolbarGroup.STUDIO` is refused, not re-homed.** The host's own section, for what would still make sense
  with every plugin uninstalled. A plugin quietly moved out of it would sit where a user reads the
  application rather than their project, so the drop is loud and names the plugin.
- **`EnabledWhen` is a closed set rather than a predicate**, and the reason is cost rather than taste: a
  `BooleanSupplier` is somebody else's code called once per item per plugin on every state change, inside a
  layout pass, with no way for the host to know what it reads. Four states the host already broadcasts make
  it a switch. An item wanting more says why in a dialog when pressed — better than a greyed button with no
  explanation.
- **No toggle kind and no read-out kind**, though the host has one of each. Adding a contract member for the
  host's only instance of a thing is exactly what the `Assets`/`SourceChoice` reversal recorded, so Studio's
  debug toggle and resolution label stay hand-built nodes placed beside the described ones.
- **`ActionContext` is three members**, on `StudioServices`' rule: the project's name (a name, not a path —
  a path invites writing into a project directory behind the host's back), the plugin's own pinned version,
  and the services. Nothing a plugin could answer for itself.

**What this surface does not yet carry, and it is the whole of phase 13:** the SDK contributes no items
through it. Its eleven buttons are still Studio's, because their actions are Studio dialogs on Studio's
project services, and moving the *declaration* without the *behaviour* would need an intent registry — which
was offered and declined. The dialogs move instead, once phase 14 gives them a project surface to stand on.

### 2026-08-28 — the GitHub Release is published from here, by JReleaser

- **`jreleaser.yml` and a `release` job in `ci.yml`.** A `v*` tag now publishes this module's GitHub
  Release from its own CI, with the `## [x.y.z]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` as the body. It used to be a
  `gh release create` inside the umbrella's `release.sh`, which keeps everything JReleaser cannot express —
  which modules are being cut, at what versions, in what order, and the tag itself. JReleaser's unit of
  work is one repository; the umbrella's is eight with a dependency order between them.
- **`tools/changelog-section.sh`** — the extractor, moved out of `release.sh` into this repository so that
  the two readers which must not disagree can both reach it: the umbrella's `check_changelog` gate calls it
  before anything is tagged, and the workflow calls it for the notes. A release whose body is extracted by
  a different rule than the one that gated it can pass the gate and then publish something else.
- **Two findings worth keeping, because each reads as a configuration mistake until you hit it.** JReleaser
  **cannot open a submodule**: in the umbrella working copy `.git` is a `gitdir:` FILE and its JGit reports
  *repository not found*, while `--git-root-search` gets past that only by resolving the **umbrella**
  repository — which would attach a module's release to the wrong repo. Hence CI, where a checkout is
  standalone. And `jreleaser-maven-plugin` is not a way round it: it ignores `jreleaser.yml` entirely (its
  model comes from an XML block in the pom) and takes the version from `<version>`, which here is the
  cosmetic `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT` JitPack overrides. The version arrives as `JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION`, read off
  the tag.
- **The build is untouched** — no Maven plugin, no lifecycle binding, no pom edit.
- Also found, and now refused in `release.sh`'s decide pass rather than halfway through a run: **this
  repository has no `origin` remote.** It was created inside the umbrella and has never been pushed. Create
  `LiQiyeDev/botmaker-studio-api` before any `--studio-api` release.

### 2026-08-27 — reflection replaces the processor, japicmp replaces the back edge

The annotation set narrows to five and the catalog stops being generated.

- **`@Facade` → `@Palette`** (the `role` element deleted) and **`meta.@Internal` → `palette.@Hidden`**,
  narrowed back to what it actually did. `FacadeRole`, `CatalogBuilder`, `MemberRef` and `M0`–`M5` deleted;
  `FacadeEntry.role` is a `boolean offered` and `isFacade()`/`inMenus()` are gone. **Two bits, not three:**
  every consumer read one, and `VALUE` only ever existed to work around `@Internal` welding *not-surface* to
  *not-offered*. All four palette annotations are `RUNTIME` now, because the plugin reflects on its own.
- **`PaletteCatalog.of(Class<?>...)`** is the entry point. Members are discovered, so the property the
  method-reference builder was defended on — *a catalog naming a renamed member does not compile* — answers
  a problem that no longer exists; the class list stays javac-checked as class literals. It also removed a
  cost only an outside plugin author would have paid: a pom omitting `<annotationProcessorPaths>` got no
  catalog and no diagnostic.
- **`SourceOrder`** (package-private, ~150 lines) parses the class file's constant pool and `methods` table
  to recover declaration order — the one processor capability reflection lacks, and what let the switch
  reproduce the SDK's generated menus exactly (52 facades, same order, every `.order(…)` prefix). Every
  failure path returns an empty list and the caller sorts alphabetically.
- **Load-time validation degrades rather than throws**, collected into `PaletteCatalog.problems()`: two
  `@PaletteDefault`s on one name, a `@PaletteLabel` on a `@Hidden` member, two facades disagreeing about a
  category label, a class with no `@Palette`, and a facade whose members cannot be read at all. That last one
  was found by hitting it — `getDeclaredMethods()` throws `NoClassDefFoundError` when a signature names a
  class the classloader lacks, and it is all-or-nothing, so the facade is reported and offered with no
  members. Precedent: `ValueCatalog.merge`.
- **Constructors are deliberately not catalogued** — reflecting them added an `<init>` entry to seven offered
  static facades. `MemberId` keeps its constructor support.
- **`@Replaces` and `@Since` deleted**; `@ReplacedBy` stays and stays `CLASS`-retention, since Studio reads it
  from a jar it never loads. **japicmp on `verify`**, unconditional, no ignore list: the record-component trap
  from `25-compatibility.md` is checked by something now. The August objection to japicmp — *CI cannot tell an
  intended break from an accident because it cannot see the version* — is about a conditional rule; both new
  uses are unconditional.

### 2026-08-27 — the host services grow to fit the editors (plugin platform, phase 12a)

Phase 12 moves the SDK's thirteen slot editors out of Studio. Surveying them first found that **four cannot
move without this module growing**, and that is the honest way to read every addition below: they are not a
guess at what a plugin might want, they are what an editor already written could not do without.

- **`Assets`**, on `StudioServices.assets()` — the project's named pictures. The `ImageTemplate` and
  `ImageTemplateGroup` editors reached `ImageTemplateLibrary`, `ProjectConfig`, `ProjectSettingsService` and
  `CoreApplicationEvents` for it. It is a service and not a directory listing because **naming one is policy
  the host owns**: reserved names, sanitising, collisions, tags, and who is told when the set changes. Two
  plugins walking `resourcesDir()` themselves would answer all of that differently about one folder.
- **`Capture.pickPoint`** — one pixel under a magnifier. Deliberately not `selectRegion` with the size thrown
  away: at 1:1 the cursor covers the pixel it is choosing.
- **`Capture.Frame` + `grabTargetFrame`** — the AWT pixels and the label of the target they came from.
  `grabFrame` hands over a JavaFX `Image`, which is right for *showing* a frame and useless for *searching*
  one, and a frame with no label leaves the user guessing which monitor was read. Never a silent desktop
  fallback: a frame of the wrong thing answers a question the editor did not ask.
- **`Capture.Sample` + `sampleFromTarget`** — the eyedropper, carrying `spread`. That number can only be
  measured at the moment of sampling (it is how much the chosen pixel's neighbourhood varies) and it is the
  honest suggested tolerance — the justification a ΔE slider has never had.
- **`Capture.SourceChoice` + `chooseSource` + `defaultSource`** — and this one is the design decision worth
  keeping. **A capture source crosses as data, never as an expression.** The host enumerates monitors, windows
  and emulator instances and paints the thumbnails; the plugin decides what a choice is *written down as*. The
  alternative — the host handing back `CaptureSource.window("…")` — would bake one plugin's vocabulary into the
  contract and make a second capture-source editor impossible.

Two shape decisions inside that:

- **`SourceChoice.Kind` is an enum component of a record, not a sealed hierarchy.** A new permitted subtype
  breaks a plugin's `switch` at recompile; a new enum constant with a documented `default` arm does not. The
  Javadoc says to read it with one.
- **`assets()` is `default`; the new `Capture` methods are not.** The rule that every addition must be
  `default` protects plugins from an older *host*, and `StudioServices` is what a plugin holds — so it gets the
  default. `Capture` is host-implemented only; an abstract method there breaks a host at compile time, which is
  a build failure in this repository rather than a user's plugin dying at runtime.

### 2026-08-27 — parameters become a plugin surface (plugin platform, phase 11)

`ValueContext` is new, and it is the AST-free half of what an editor needs: `TypeRef type()`,
`List<String> value()`, `void set(List<String>)`, `StudioServices services()`. `SlotContext` **extends** it
with the source-text half and its `slotType()` is gone — the inherited `type()` was the same question asked
twice. `SlotEditor` widened from `SlotContext` to `ValueContext` in all three of `matches`, `create` and
`of`, and that widening is the whole point: **one editor now serves both the code editor's argument slot and
the Parameters window**, because both are "a value of a Java type", and a plugin writes the predicate once.
`asSlot()` is how an editor that genuinely needs the call site asks for it — null when there is none.

`ParameterGroup(id, title, className)` is new, and `StudioPlugin` gains
`default List<ParameterGroup> parameters(String pinnedVersion)` — empty by default, so the contract's rule
that every method but `id()` is `default` is intact. A group is **one plugin's section of the Parameters
window and one generated file**, which is the whole-file-ownership rule applied to parameters: two plugins
may both offer a `timeout` because they are fields of two classes. `DEFAULT_ID` is `""`, so a project
written before groups existed reads back as the default plugin's — no migration, and the discriminator is
absent rather than wrong.

Nothing here carries a JSON annotation, and that is deliberate: the contract's one dependency is
`javafx-controls` at `provided`, and a serialiser added here would be imposed on every plugin ever written.
The contract declares the wire *form*; whoever owns the file supplies the parser (the SDK's `ValueJson`).

### 2026-08-27 — a value type says where a picker files it (plugin platform, phase 10b)

`ValueType.group()` — a free `String`, `""` for the top level — and `Builder.group(…)`. Studio's picker used
to read the grouping off `BotType.Group`, an enum in Studio, which is exactly the constant a second plugin
could never be granted: a plugin's own types would have arrived in a menu with nowhere to sit. A free string
for the same reason the class is not an enum.

The ordering rule is worth stating because it is the one a second plugin could otherwise use to disturb the
first: types carrying the same group are shown together in **registration** order, and the **first**
registration of a group decides where that group sits. A plugin cannot reorder another's menu by naming its
heading.

### 2026-08-27 — the compatibility vocabulary arrives (plugin platform, phase 8c.4)

`@ReplacedBy`, `@Replaces` and `@Since` are `com.botmaker.plugin.api.meta` now, beside `@Internal`. They were
`com.botmaker.sdk.api.meta`, which made them the SDK's rather than every plugin's — compatibility trap #8:
a second plugin renaming its own public types had no equivalent and its users' bots broke with a bare compile
error. `botmaker-plugin-processor` already checked them by FQN string, so the move is what makes that
checking usable by anybody.

- **The SDK's three survive one minor** as `@Deprecated(forRemoval = true)` shims with `@ReplacedBy` at the
  new FQNs, so the pointer pair's first use is its own move. Nothing about the grammar changed.
- **A pointer may name a target in another module** — which the move is the first instance of. The
  `@version` on such a `@Replaces` entry is the **old** module's: the last release *that* module shipped the
  old spelling in, because the entry is a statement about a spelling being retired.
- **A scan that folds meta-annotations must filter to direct ones.** These three annotate each other now, so
  ClassGraph reports `@Since`'s own `@Replaces` on every element that merely uses `@Since`. `javax.lang.model`
  has no such folding, so the processor is unaffected; a host reading pointers out of a jar is not.

Two earlier arrivals in this module are logged in `../botmaker-sdk/ROADMAP.md` rather than here, because the
work that moved them was the SDK's: the palette annotations and `@Internal` (phases 8 and 8c.2), and the
value vocabulary under `com.botmaker.plugin.api.value` (phase 10a).

### 2026-08-26 — the module exists (plugin platform, phase 5)

Created as the seventh BotMaker repository, first in the umbrella reactor. It holds the contract that lets
Studio become a **plugin host** and `botmaker-sdk` become plugin #1 — a privileged default plugin, but a
plugin, with no back door into the host.

**Why a separate repository rather than a package in the SDK or in Studio.** The contract must be allowed to
version *slower* than either. A bot's source can be rewritten when the SDK changes, because Studio holds an
AST of it; a plugin's compiled `.class` files cannot be rewritten by anybody. Putting the contract in the
SDK would tie its cadence to the SDK's, which changes every week, and a third-party plugin would then depend
on the whole SDK to implement two interfaces.

**What landed:**

- `com.botmaker.plugin.api` — `StudioPlugin` (every method but `id()` a `default`), `SlotEditor`,
  `SlotContext`, `TypeRef`, `StudioServices`, `Theme`, `Capture`, `Dialogs`, `Region`.
- `com.botmaker.plugin.api.catalog` — `PaletteCatalog`, `CatalogBuilder`, `Category`, `FacadeEntry`,
  `MemberEntry`, `MemberId`, `MemberRef`, `M0`–`M5`.
- `CatalogBuilderTest`, 13 tests, all on the one claim the design rests on: that a method reference carries
  enough identity to name an *overload*.

**The decisions worth not re-litigating**, each taken against a named alternative:

- **A slot editor returns a `javafx.scene.Node`**, so the platform is pinned to JavaFX permanently. The
  alternative was a UI-factory abstraction; the editors worth writing (image template, capture source,
  launch target) are bespoke, and a factory able to express them would be larger than JavaFX.
- **A catalog entry is a method reference**, read through `SerializedLambda`. The alternatives were strings
  (nothing checks them) and class literals plus strings (the maintainer's objection: *"I don't like
  literals"*, and the same non-checking on the member half). The reference is checked by javac.
- **One void-returning shape per arity, `M0`–`M5`.** A value-returning shape beside `M1` would make `add`
  ambiguous for most real members, since a reference to a value-returning method is compatible with a
  void-returning interface. Ambiguity within one arity is the caller's, via a type witness.
- **No shaded plugin toolkit** — with the contract at interfaces and records, there is nothing to shade
  against.
- **Panels are not a surface.** Plugins contribute to the editor; they do not contribute editors.
- **No flatten-maven-plugin and no `.deps.env`**, unlike session and the SDK: this module pins no BotMaker
  upstream, so there is nothing to inject and nothing to bake.

## Deferred / next

- **The SDK's per-version catalog** (phase 6) — one frozen class per released `SdkVersion`, built as the
  previous one plus deltas, plus a `release.sh` gate: editing an already-released catalog is only possible
  when a member it names is deleted, so the edit *is* the removal signal.
- **Studio reads the catalog** (phase 7) — `SdkSurfaceService` curation switches over and `palette/SdkType`
  retires.
- **The slot editors move into the SDK** (phase 8) — thirteen of them, plus the Steam/Epic scanners moving
  to `botmaker-shared`.
- **Dynamic plugin loading** — `ServiceLoader` over a `URLClassLoader` built from the resolved artifact.
  A loader, not a redesign, and worth writing once a second plugin exists.
- **A dockable side-panel surface** — one interface (a title and a `Node`), the cheapest honest answer if a
  plugin ever needs to *show* something. Full editor views stay out.
- **Nothing here has a second implementor yet**, and one implementor proves little. The contract's real
  validation is a second plugin; until then the mitigation is that the SDK consumes it as an ordinary
  plugin.
