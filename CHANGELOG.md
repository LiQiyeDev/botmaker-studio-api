# Changelog

What each released version of `botmaker-studio-api` changes, in a few bullets. `ROADMAP.md` stays the
detailed engineering log; this is the short answer, and it is what `release.sh` publishes as the GitHub
Release body.

**`release.sh` refuses to cut a version with no section here** (`check_changelog`, decide pass, before
anything is tagged). If the top section still says `## [Unreleased]`, rename it to the version being cut and
date it.

Sections are `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD`, newest first.

**This module's compatibility rule is stricter than any other in the repository, and every entry below should
be read against it:** a plugin's compiled `.class` files cannot be rewritten by anybody, so a change here
that an already-built plugin cannot survive is a **major** change, and one that only a Studio major release
is allowed to make. Additions arrive as `default` methods.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Compiled for Java 25 (LTS), against JavaFX 25.0.4.** A plugin compiling against this contract needs a
  JDK 25 or newer; a host loading one needs a 25 runtime. This is a floor rather than a feature — nothing in
  the contract changed shape — but it is the kind of floor that produces `UnsupportedClassVersionError` at
  load rather than a compile error, so it is worth reading before upgrading. The poms say
  `maven.compiler.release` now instead of `source`/`target`, which is what makes the platform API checked
  rather than merely the bytecode level.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-09-02

First release. **`0.x` on purpose**: the contract is still in development, there are no third-party plugins,
and the one implementor — the SDK — is rebuilt from the same reactor on every change. The never-grow-a-record
rule that protects already-compiled plugins is suspended until a second plugin exists, and a `1.0.0` would
claim a stability this does not yet have.

### The contract

- **`StudioPlugin`** — what a plugin implements. **Every method but `id()` is `default`**, which is the whole
  versioning strategy of the module: a plugin built against an older contract keeps loading, and a host
  meeting an older plugin gets the declined value rather than an `AbstractMethodError`.

  Eight surfaces: `id`, `displayName`, `catalog(pinnedVersion)`, `slotEditors`, `sourceSeeds`, `valueTypes`,
  `parameters(pinnedVersion)`, `toolbarItems`, and the lifecycle callback `projectClosing`.

- **`StudioServices`** — what the host offers back: `projectDir`, `resourcesDir`, `theme`, `dialogs`, and the
  three `default` ones — `runs()`, `sources()` and `status(String)`.

  **The rule for what may ever go here is that the host must be the *only possible* source of it.** Not that
  the host happened to write it first, and not that a real editor needed it — that was the earlier test, and
  it is what let the contract grow a vocabulary belonging to one plugin. An `Assets` service and a
  `Capture.SourceChoice`/`Frame`/`Sample` family were built during development and **deleted before this
  release**: they named one plugin's concepts (a *named picture*, a *capture source*) in the contract's own
  package, which no second plugin could have done. Everything a plugin might otherwise ask the host for it
  can do itself, because `botmaker-shared` is published and any plugin may depend on it — enumerating
  monitors, windows and emulator instances, grabbing their pixels, reading an installed game library. **The
  contract grows capabilities, never vocabularies.**

### The palette

- **`PaletteCatalog`, built by reflection** — `PaletteCatalog.of(Mouse.class, Keyboard.class, …)`. One class
  literal per facade, so the class list is javac-checked; the members are discovered from the type's own
  `getDeclaredMethods()`. `FacadeEntry`, `MemberEntry`, `MemberId`, `Category` and `SourceOrder` describe
  the result.
- **Curation is opt-out and its unit is the member *name*, not the overload** — every public declared method
  is offered, as one menu entry per name with a lead shape and a submenu. The exceptions travel with the
  member they annotate, in `com.botmaker.plugin.api.palette`: **`@Palette`** on the type (this type is
  catalogued), **`@Hidden`** on a type or member (not offered), **`@PaletteLabel`** and **`@PaletteDefault`**.
  All four are `RUNTIME`, because the plugin reflects on them itself.
- **Two bits, not three states.** `@Palette` says *catalogued* — the recognition set, which answers imports
  and *does `Point` mean this plugin's or `java.awt`'s*. `@Hidden` says *not offered*. A value type being
  recognised but never proposed is the ordinary case, and it needs no third state to express.
- **A malformed catalog is collected, never thrown.** `PaletteCatalog.problems()` reports a bad category, two
  leads on one name or a label on a hidden member. `ValueCatalog.merge` is the precedent and the rule behind
  both is the same: **no malformed catalog may be why a project will not open.**
- **Present means curated.** A type in a catalog offers exactly the members it lists; a type absent from it is
  not offered. An entry with an empty member list is a verdict, not an omission.

### The value vocabulary — open, and the contract's rather than any plugin's

- **`com.botmaker.plugin.api.value`**: `ValueType`, `ValueShape`, `ValueChoice`, `Visibility`, `Range`,
  `ValueCodec<T>` and `ValueCatalog`.
- **`ValueType` is not an enum.** Its identity is the persisted `id()`; it is built through `ValueType.of(id)`
  and registered in a `ValueCatalog`. A closed enum is right for one plugin and wrong for two — a plugin
  wanting a `Channel` variable would need a constant granted in somebody else's enum, which is the back door
  the platform exists to close. **Never compare a `ValueType` by object identity**: two plugin classloaders
  make that meaningless, and the id is what the file holds anyway.
- **`ValueType.unknown(id)` is what makes an open vocabulary safe.** An id nothing registered keeps its raw
  text, renders read-only and declines to emit. That state was unreachable while the set was closed; it is
  the ordinary state of a project opened without one of its plugins.
- **`ValueCodec<T>` is per *item*, not per value** — `parse(String)` / `store(T)` / `literal(T)`. Shape is
  composed above it by `ValueCatalog.initializer`, so one codec serves all four shapes without knowing they
  exist, and `T` never crosses to the host: only `literal(parse(wire))`, behind a wildcard capture. **The
  host never loads a plugin's value class.**
- **`ValueCatalog.types()` answers in registration order**, and a merge appends rather than reshuffling, so
  installing a second plugin does not reorder the first's types. (It held a `Map.copyOf` during development,
  whose iteration order is unspecified *and randomised per JVM run* — every "what type is this variable"
  dropdown came out different each time the host started.)
- **No JSON annotations, deliberately.** The contract declares the wire *form*; whoever owns the file supplies
  the parser. Adding a JSON library here would impose it on every plugin.

### Editing a value

- **`SlotEditor`** — `matches(TypeRef)` / `create(SlotContext)`, plus `preview(ValueContext)` (`default null`)
  for the one place the host *shows* a value without editing it: beside a declared choice, in the list an
  author picks from. Plain text is wrong there whenever the stored string is a reference rather than the
  value — a template name is not a picture.
- **`SlotContext`** carries `enclosingClass()`, `enclosingMethod()` and `argIndex()`, so an editor can be
  chosen by the **call** rather than by the type — the only way to tell a Steam app id from a window title
  when both are `String`.
- **`SlotContext.enclosingSource()` and `replaceEnclosingCall(String, String...)`** — an editor may rewrite the
  whole call its slot sits in, not only the slot, for when the choice is a **shape** rather than a value:
  *"wait somewhere between 800ms and 2s"* is not a different duration from *"2s"*, it is a two-argument call
  where there was a one-argument one. Source text in, source text out, exactly like `replaceWith`.
- **`SlotRun`, reached through `SlotContext.run()`** — several sibling slots edited as one, for a value the
  author writes as a *run* of arguments (three pictures to match any of). `elements()` are the run's Java
  expressions in order; `replace(List<String>, String...)` writes the whole run, because an editor confined
  to one argument can change an element and never add or remove one. `minimum()` and `allowed()` are the
  host's two narrowings — how few elements the surrounding code still compiles with, and the only element
  sources it will still accept — and **both are opaque Java source**: the host says these arguments are one
  list and what the code around them permits, and the plugin, which knows what the strings mean, decodes
  them itself. `null` for a slot that stands alone, which is nearly every slot.
- **`ValueContext`** is the same value seen from the Parameters window, where there is no call and no syntax
  tree. One editor serves both.

### Rewriting the user's Java

- **`Sources`, reached through `StudioServices.sources()`.** `find(List<String>)` answers where a needle
  occurs; `replace(Map, historyLabel, reviewNote)` rewrites it in the open buffer *and* on disk and says which
  files changed. `Sources.NONE` is the total no-op a host with no project answers with, so a plugin never
  null-checks and never asks whether rewriting is supported.
- **Needles are matched as tokens, never as text**: `Templates.ORE` matches `Templates . ORE` and does not
  match `Templates.OREX` or `MyTemplates.ORE`; `"images/ore.png"` matches that whole string literal and
  nothing inside a longer one. **Tokens rather than a regex on purpose** — a regex would hand every plugin the
  power to corrupt a user's source with a bad pattern, and would pin one flavour of regex semantics into a
  surface only a major release may break. **Text rather than an AST, equally on purpose**: the file that most
  needs a rename to reach it is the one the user has open and half-edited, which does not parse.
- It passes the host-only test on every part — the open buffers are editor state, the walk knows which files
  the bot owns, and the review mark and the history snapshot are the host's own undo model — while what to
  search for stays entirely with whoever owns the thing being renamed. **`Use` is host-constructed only**, so
  it may grow a component later without the `NoSuchMethodError` every already-compiled plugin would take from
  a changed canonical constructor; for the same reason replacements are a `Map<String,String>` rather than a
  record a plugin would call a constructor on.
- **`SourceSeed`** — the starting expression for a type the host is asked to write down and knows nothing
  about, so the host carries no arm per plugin type.

### The toolbar — the one surface where a plugin contributes data

- **`StudioPlugin.toolbarItems()`**, with `ToolbarItem`, `ToolbarGroup`, `EnabledWhen` and `ActionContext`.
  **The plugin contributes data and the host builds the node**, deliberately unlike `SlotEditor`, which hands
  back a `Node`. The difference is expressiveness, not consistency: a bespoke image picker cannot be described
  as data and a button can, and describing it as data is what lets the host keep what a *shared* bar has to
  own — grouping, ordering, packing, the overflow menu, the icon box and the theme. Two plugins returning
  nodes would produce a bar with two button heights.
- **The label and the icon are `Supplier`s**, because the host's own bar already had two buttons that relabel
  from project state and a third that resolves a game's real title and cover art on a background thread. A
  record of `String` would have described a toolbar nobody has. The obligation is stated where it will be
  read: cheap and pure, called during layout.
- **`ToolbarGroup` is a closed enum the host owns**, and `ToolbarGroup.STUDIO` is **refused** with the plugin
  named — quietly re-homing it would put a plugin's button where a user reads the application rather than
  their project. A plugin picks a group and an order within it; it cannot open a section, because a bar whose
  shape depends on install order is a bar nobody can predict.
- **`EnabledWhen` is a closed set, not a `BooleanSupplier`** — four states the host already broadcasts, so
  enablement is a switch rather than somebody else's code run once per item per plugin inside a layout pass.

### Parameters, the project model, and the lifecycle

- **`ParameterGroup`** — a plugin declares the sections of the Parameters window it owns fields of, and the
  **categories** those fields may be filed under. The host had been deriving its own rail headings by reading
  two files one plugin owns, which is the mirror image of the vocabulary leak: not the host spelling a
  plugin's types, but the host reading a plugin's data to decide its own UI.
- **`com.botmaker.plugin.api.authoring`** — `ProjectModel`, `ActivityModel`, `VariableModel`, `FlowModel`,
  `FlowNodeModel`, `FlowEdgeModel`, `PresetModel`: the shape of a project a plugin may be handed.
- **`StudioPlugin.projectClosing()`** — the open project is closing; release anything held on its behalf.
  Called once per bind, on the plugins that were serving the project being left and **before** their
  classloader is closed, so a plugin can still run its own code. It is not a contribution surface — it
  contributes nothing — and it is the one thing a plugin cannot find out for itself: that the project it
  opened a port, a nested display or a child process for is gone. Anything releasable by garbage collection
  needs no implementation. The instance is reused across projects, so this says *this project is over*, never
  *you are being discarded*.
- **`Runs`, reached through `StudioServices.runs()`** — the open project's bot as a running process: `start`,
  `stop`, `isRunning`, `pid`, and listeners for run state and for telemetry. Host-only for the plainest
  reason on the interface: the host compiled the project, holds its resolved classpath and owns the process.
  **Telemetry crosses as one encoded frame, not a decoded shape** — the format belongs to whichever runtime
  the bot is built on, and that runtime decodes its own wire, exactly as `SlotContext` passes Java source
  rather than a syntax tree. Bytes rather than text because the wire already is bytes and has one definition;
  a text rendering invented for the contract would be owned by neither end.

### Compatibility

- **`com.botmaker.plugin.api.meta.@ReplacedBy`** — the one redirect annotation, and it is the contract's
  rather than the SDK's because it says how *any* library keeps faith with the code that calls it. Its value
  is `fqn`, `fqn#member` or `fqn#<init>`, and **`{}` means "nothing takes my place"** — an explicit statement
  rather than an omission. It also carries `note()` (the author's own sentence, shown verbatim), a
  `behaviourChanged()` flag for the one break a host cannot see by construction, and a parallel `whens()` so a
  member that became **two** is expressible: which candidate a call meant is a property of *that call*.
- `@Retention(CLASS)`, read out of a jar the host never loads, and with no business in a running bot's
  reflection data. (The four palette annotations are `RUNTIME` for the opposite reason.)

### Deliberately absent

- **Any dependency but `javafx-controls`**, at a literal version, at `provided` scope, because a slot editor
  returns a `javafx.scene.Node`. **No BotMaker upstream at all** — which is the only shape in which this
  module can version more slowly than the SDK, and is why it needs neither a flatten nor a `.deps.env`. If a
  BotMaker dependency ever appears here, that is the thing to refuse.
- **No parsing library.** A plugin writes back Java source as text.
- **A panel or view surface.** Out of scope, and recorded as such in `docs/refactor/24-plugin-platform.md`.
- **A scaffold surface.** `com.botmaker.plugin.api.scaffold` existed during development and was deleted
  before this release: a plugin no longer contributes files to a user's project at all. **A project's
  structure belongs to the user, and a plugin contributes methods a user calls.** A file a plugin owns inside
  somebody's source tree is a file its user cannot freely edit, rename or delete, and the ledger, reconciler
  and rename engine that kept such a file owned were all cost paid to work around that.
- **A `SwitchHandler`, or anything else taking a JDT type.** Declined: the contract needs no JDT, and the
  host's AST never becomes plugin surface. A language construct the host would compose on a plugin's behalf
  is a vocabulary, not a capability.
