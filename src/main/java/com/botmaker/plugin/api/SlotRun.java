 * Several sibling slots that are edited as <b>one</b> thing.

 * It is the wrong shape for a value the author writes as a <em>run</em> of arguments — three pictures to
 * match any of, four keys to try in order — where an editor confined to a single argument can change one
 * element and can never add or remove one. Such an editor has to hand back the whole run at once, which is
 * what {@link #replace} is for.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything here is opaque source text, and that is the point.</b> The elements are Java
 * expressions exactly as they stand in the file; nothing in this interface names a type, a picture, a key
 * or any other concept belonging to one plugin. What the host contributes is the thing only the host has —
 * knowing that these arguments are one list, and what the surrounding code will still accept — and what
 * the plugin contributes is knowing what the strings mean. That is the same division
 * {@link SlotContext#replaceEnclosingCall} is built on.
 *
 * <p>Reached through {@link SlotContext#run()}, which is {@code null} for a slot that stands alone. An
 * editor that does not care simply never asks, and keeps working exactly as before.
