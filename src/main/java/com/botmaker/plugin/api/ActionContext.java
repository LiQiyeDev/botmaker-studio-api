 * What a {@link ToolbarItem}'s click is handed: the host facts an action cannot get for itself.

 * <p>It is small, and the rule that keeps it small is the platform's standing one — <b>the host must be the
 * only possible source.</b> Which project is open, which version of this plugin it pins, the theme and the
 * owning window are things only Studio knows. Enumerating windows, grabbing pixels, reading a Steam library
 * and everything else a toolbar action might want are things a plugin does for itself, because
 * {@code botmaker-shared} is published and any plugin may depend on it.
 *
 * <p>That rule was learned rather than assumed: the contract grew an {@code Assets} and a
 * {@code SourceChoice} in 2026-08-27 and both were deleted the same day, because the host owned those
 * policies only by accident of having been written first. Add nothing here that a plugin could answer alone.
