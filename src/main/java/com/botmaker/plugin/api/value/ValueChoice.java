     * <p>A variable's type is the one part of the file whose <em>vocabulary</em> changed. Files written
     * before the shape axis existed say {@code {"type":"CHOICE","list":false}} — {@code CHOICE} being a
     * pseudo-type meaning "text out of a written-down set", and {@code list} a boolean where the shape now
     * is. Migrating here rather than in an open-time pass means every reader gets it: the project loader, a
     * hand-copied file, a test fixture.
     *
     * <p>The type arrives as a {@code String} and is resolved through {@code catalog}, so an id nothing
     * registers becomes an {@linkplain ValueType#unknown unknown type} rather than a failed open. The shape
     * arrives as a {@code String} too, so that parse stays total as well.
     *
     * <p>What this cannot decide is {@link ValueShape#ANY_OF} versus {@link ValueShape#OPEN_LIST} for a file
     * written before they were split: the answer is whether the variable declares choices, and the choices
     * are a sibling field this factory never sees. The variable's own reader settles it, where both are in
     * hand.
     *
     * @param catalog what resolves an id; the legacy {@code CHOICE} pseudo-type never reaches it
