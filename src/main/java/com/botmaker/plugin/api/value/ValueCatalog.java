/**
 * The types a project's variables may be typed with, and what each one's stored text means. What used to be
 * an enum and a {@code switch} in two places.
 *
 * <h2>Open, and therefore holey</h2>
 *
 * <p>A catalog answers for the types it was built with and admits it about the rest. {@link #type(String)} is
 * <b>total</b>: an id nothing registered comes back as {@link ValueType#unknown}, whose value survives, shows
 * read-only, and emits nothing. That is not a degraded case to be minimised — it is the normal state of a
 * project whose plugin is not installed today, and the alternative (dropping the value, or refusing the open)
 * destroys a user's data because a jar is missing.
 *
 * <h2>Merging is how the editor assembles one vocabulary from several plugins</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #merge(ValueCatalog)} is left-biased and never throws: the receiver's registrations win an id
 * clash. Refusing would let one plugin's bad id stop the editor from opening any project at all, and
 * last-writer-wins would make the answer depend on jar ordering. Whoever merges should report a clash it
 * dropped; nothing here can, because nothing here knows how to talk to a user.
 *
 * <p>This is deliberately unlike the whole-file collision rule that governs generation, where two claimants
 * is a hard error before a byte is written. The difference is what is at stake: there, refusing costs a
 * regenerate; here, it costs every project.
