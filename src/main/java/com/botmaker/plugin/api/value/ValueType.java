/**
 * One kind of value a project variable can hold — {@code DURATION}, {@code POINT}, a plugin's own
 * {@code CHANNEL}. <b>Not an enum any more</b>, which is the whole of this class's reason to exist.
 *
 * <h2>Why it stopped being an enum</h2>
 *
 * <p>It was seventeen constants in the SDK, and a closed set is exactly right for as long as there is one
 * plugin. It is wrong the moment there are two: an enum cannot be extended, so a Discord plugin wanting a
 * {@code Channel} variable would have to be granted a constant in somebody else's enum — a back door of
 * precisely the kind the plugin platform exists to close. The seventeen are still declared in one place; that
 * place is now the SDK's own {@linkplain ValueCatalog catalog}, registered the same way any plugin registers
 * its own, through the same builder, with no privilege the second plugin is denied.
 *
 * <p>What is lost with the enum is the exhaustive {@code switch}, and it was load-bearing in two places (the
 * literal writer and the closed-set test). Both become {@link ValueCatalog} lookups, which is the honest
 * shape: neither could ever have been exhaustive over a set the host does not own.
 *
 * <h2>Identity is the id, and the id is persisted</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #id()} is what the project file says and what {@link #equals} compares — never the object, which
 * a plugin classloader would make useless (two loaders, two {@code Channel} types, one file). Renaming an id
 * rewrites every stored project's meaning silently; don't.
 *
 * <h2>Unknown types</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #unknown(String)} is what a catalog answers for an id nothing registered — a plugin that is not
 * installed, or was uninstalled after writing the file. It is {@linkplain #known() marked}, holds its raw
 * text, renders read-only and <b>declines to emit</b>. That state was impossible while this was an enum, and
 * is unavoidable now: an open registry is a registry with holes in it. The alternative — dropping the value —
 * destroys a user's data because a jar is missing.
 *
 * <h2>Built, never constructed</h2>
 *
 * <p>Instances come from {@link #of(String)}. There is no public constructor and this is not a record,
 * deliberately: a record's canonical constructor is part of its binary signature, so gaining one component
 * would throw {@code NoSuchMethodError} in every plugin already compiled. A builder can gain a method.
