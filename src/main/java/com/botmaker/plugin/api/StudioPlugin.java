/**
 * What a BotMaker Studio plugin is, from the host's side: an id and a set of contributions.
 *
 * <p><b>Every method but {@link #id()} is {@code default}, and that is the versioning rule of the whole
 * platform.</b> A bot's own source can be rewritten when the SDK changes — Studio holds an AST of it — but a
 * plugin's compiled {@code .class} files cannot be rewritten by anybody. So this contract may only gain
 * members that older plugins can ignore. A method a plugin has not implemented returns "nothing to
 * contribute" rather than throwing {@code AbstractMethodError}, which means a plugin built against an
 * earlier release of this module keeps working across every Studio release until a Studio <em>major</em>
 * bump explicitly refuses it.
 *
 * <h2>The contribution surfaces</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>palette</b> — {@link #catalog(String)}: the types and members worth proposing, their groups and
 *       their order.</li>
 *   <li><b>slot editors</b> — {@link #slotEditors()}: "for a value of type X, show this UI instead of a
 *       text field". They serve both places the host edits a value: a slot in a bot's Java, and a row in
 *       the Parameters window.</li>
 *   <li><b>value types</b> — {@link #valueTypes()}: the types a project variable may hold, and what their
 *       stored text means.</li>
 *   <li><b>parameters</b> — {@link #parameters(String)}: the sections of the Parameters window this plugin
 *       owns, and the generated class each one's values become fields of.</li>
 *   <li><b>toolbar</b> &mdash; {@link #toolbarItems()}: buttons, contributed as data. The host owns the
 *       grouping, the order, the packing and the overflow menu; a plugin owns what a press does.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link #projectClosing()} is not a sixth surface — it contributes nothing. It is the one thing a plugin
 * cannot find out for itself: that the project it opened an operating-system resource for is gone.
 *
 * <p><b>Panels are deliberately not a surface.</b> A plugin contributes to the editor; it does not
 * contribute editors. The Activity Canvas and every other whole view stays the host's.
 *
 * <p><b>Neither are files.</b> There was briefly a sixth surface — {@code scaffold} and {@code seedings},
 * through which a plugin shipped real compiling classes that a host wrote into a user's project and then
 * maintained forever. It is gone, and the rule that replaces it is the one to apply to anything proposed in
 * its place: <b>a project's structure belongs to the user, and a plugin contributes methods a user calls.</b>
 * A file a plugin owns inside somebody's source tree is a file its user cannot freely edit, rename or delete,
 * and the machinery that keeps such a file owned — a key ledger, a reconciler, a rename engine — is all cost
 * paid to work around that one fact. Everything a seed was for has an answer on this side of the line:
 * behaviour is a static method the user calls, and anything that followed from project data was data all
 * along and is read at runtime.
