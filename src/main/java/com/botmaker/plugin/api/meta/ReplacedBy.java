/**
 * Written on a deprecated type, method, constructor or field: <em>this is what to use instead</em>.
 *
 * <h2>What it is for</h2>
 *
 * <p>When a bot is upgraded to a newer version of a plugin, Studio has both jars in hand and diffs them. A
 * diff can see that {@code ImageClicker#click} is gone and {@code IClicker#tap} has appeared; it cannot see
 * that one became the other. Read as a removal, a rename turns into hundreds of calls replaced by default
 * values — the single worst thing an upgrade can do to someone's project.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is the forward half of the answer, and it is read out of the <b>bot's own (older)</b>
 * jar: the bot still spells the member the old way, so the old jar is where the pointer to the new spelling
 * has to be. The backward half is {@link Replaces}, read out of the newer jar. Either one alone resolves a
 * single hop; the two <b>compose</b>, which is what lets a bot that skipped several releases follow a chain
 * of renames without any intermediate jar ever being fetched.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // 1.2.0 — the window in which both spellings exist
 * @Deprecated(since = "1.2.0", forRemoval = true)
 * @ReplacedBy("com.botmaker.sdk.api.vision.IClicker#tap")
 * public boolean click(ImageTemplate t) { return tap(t); }
 *
 * @Replaces("com.botmaker.sdk.api.vision.ImageClicker#click@1.2.0")
 * public boolean tap(ImageTemplate t) { … }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>The grammar</h2>
 *
 * <p>A target is {@code fqn} for a type, {@code fqn#member} for a method or field, {@code fqn#<init>} for a
 * constructor. An enum constant <em>is</em> a static field, so {@code …interaction.Key#ENTER} names one.
 * There is <b>no arity</b> in the string: the annotation sits on one specific overload, so the parameter
 * count of both ends is already known from the bytecode. ({@link Replaces} <em>does</em> admit an optional
 * arity, because by the time it is read the overload it took over may no longer exist to be counted.)
 *
 * <p>The target need not live in the same module as the element pointing at it. A type moving from a plugin
 * into this contract is an ordinary rename with an unusually long fully-qualified name, and the vocabulary's
 * own move — {@code com.botmaker.sdk.api.meta} to here — is written exactly that way.
 *
 * <h2>One old member, two new ones</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #value()} is an <b>array</b>, and a second one, {@link #whens()}, carries a sentence per
 * candidate. That is the whole of the split mechanism, and it is deliberately not a resolution mechanism:
 * the author states the alternatives and the condition each applies under, and the <em>user</em> picks, once
 * per call site, from the candidates that compile there. See {@link #value()} for why per-site is the only
 * correct granularity.
 *
 * <h2>The rules that make a pointer safe</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>An empty value is an explicit statement</b>, not an omission: nothing takes this element's place,
 *       {@code {}} and {@code {""}} being the same statement,
 *       and Studio should replace its uses with a default value and mark them for review. The annotation is
 *       required on every deprecated public element precisely so that the author decides rather than forgets
 *       — a build gate checks it.
 *   <li><b>Write it at the moment of the change</b>, in the release that deprecates the element, never
 *       reconstructed later. That is also when the element it names is still compilable, which is what lets
 *       the gate verify the link with nothing but this build.
 *   <li><b>A pointer is a suggestion Studio checks, not an instruction it obeys.</b> The two return types are
 *       both in hand: in statement position the target's type cannot matter and the redirect is always taken;
 *       in expression position the redirect is taken only when the new type fits where the old one did, and
 *       otherwise the call falls back to a default value. A pointer can therefore be wrong without producing
 *       a bot that compiles and misbehaves.
 *   <li><b>A pointer can be corrected</b> in a later release — it is an ordinary annotation, not an identity.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Why {@link RetentionPolicy#CLASS}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Studio reads this from the published jar with the ClassGraph scan it already runs over a plugin's types,
 * so it has to survive compilation. It does not need to be visible at runtime: nothing in a running bot ever
 * asks what a member used to be called.

     * What to use instead — each {@code fqn}, {@code fqn#member} or {@code fqn#<init>} — <b>in preference
     * order, first preferred</b>. Empty ({@code {}}, and equivalently {@code {""}}) means nothing takes this
     * element's place.
     *
     * <p>Almost every pointer names exactly one target, and {@code @ReplacedBy("…#tap")} is still written and
     * still means what it always did — an array-typed annotation element accepts a bare value. The array form
     * exists for the case the single-target model could not express at all: a <b>split</b>, where one old
     * member becomes two, and <em>which</em> one a given call meant is a property of that call rather than of
     * the member. {@code Mouse#scroll(int)} is the worked example — the sign of {@code notches} decides
     * whether it meant {@code scrollUp} or {@code scrollDown}, and no annotation can know the sign.
     *
     * <p>So a split does not resolve here; it is <b>offered</b>. Studio lists every call site with its own
     * combo of the candidates that compile <em>there</em>, preselected to the first that survives, and
     * {@link #whens()} is what makes that combo readable. A menu of bare member names is not a choice anybody
     * can make, which is why the gate refuses a multi-target pointer whose {@code whens()} is missing.

     * rename lands silently and correctly, which is the whole point. But "same shape, different behaviour" —
     * a click that now targets the match's centre, a wait that now counts from a different instant — is
     * exactly a same-shape redirect, and the bot compiles and quietly does something else. That is the worst
     * outcome the model admits, and nothing in the bytecode reveals it.
     *
     * <p>So the author says it. Studio marks every redirected call site {@code @NeedsReview} when this is
     * set, even where the shape did not move, with {@link #note()} as the mark's text — which is why the gate
     * refuses {@code behaviourChanged = true} with a blank {@code note}: a flag with no sentence tells the
