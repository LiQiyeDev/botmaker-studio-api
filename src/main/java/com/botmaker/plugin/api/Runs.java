/**
 * The open project's bot, as a running process — start it, stop it, and hear about it.
 *
 * <p>Every member here passes the host-only test on {@link StudioServices} for the same reason: the host
 * compiled the project, holds its resolved classpath and owns the process it launched. A plugin cannot start
 * a bot, cannot learn that one exited, and cannot discover a pid it never spawned. It is a
 * <b>capability</b> — nothing in this interface names a concept belonging to any plugin's API.
 *
 * <h2>Telemetry crosses as its own wire bytes, and that is the whole reason it can cross at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #onTelemetry} hands over <em>one encoded frame</em>, and this module has no idea what is in it.
 * The format belongs to whichever runtime the bot is built on, and that runtime decodes its own wire — the
 * same trick {@link SlotContext#currentSource()} plays with Java source, and for the same reason: a decoded
 * shape crossing here would be a vocabulary, which is exactly what the contract refuses to carry. A host
 * that relays a frame it cannot read is doing its job.
 *
 * <p>Bytes rather than text because the wire already <em>is</em> bytes and has exactly one definition. A
 * text rendering would be a second encoding of the same thing, owned by neither end and drifting from
 * both.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here is guaranteed to do anything</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #NONE} is what a host that does not run bots answers, and it is total: no run ever starts, no
 * listener ever fires, and unregistering is a no-op. A plugin therefore never null-checks and never asks
 * whether the host supports running — it registers, and a host with nothing to say says nothing.

     *
