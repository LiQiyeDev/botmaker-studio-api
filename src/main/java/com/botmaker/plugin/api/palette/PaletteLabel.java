/**
 * The name this member reads under in the palette, when its own is not the clearest thing to show — a
 * {@code sleepMillis} that should read <i>Wait (milliseconds)</i>, a {@code findAny} that should read
 * <i>Find any of…</i>.
 *
 * <p>It labels a <em>member name</em>, not one overload: every overload of the annotated method shares the
 * label, because they share a submenu. Annotating two overloads of one name with different labels is an
 * error the processor reports.
 *
 * <p>A label on a member that is not offered — {@link com.botmaker.plugin.api.meta.Internal}, or not
 * public — is also an error,
 * rather than being silently ignored: it means the author believed a menu entry existed that does not.
