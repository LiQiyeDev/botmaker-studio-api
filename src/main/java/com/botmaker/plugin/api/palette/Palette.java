/**
 * Declares a class as part of this plugin's palette: {@link
 * com.botmaker.plugin.api.catalog.PaletteCatalog#of(Class[]) PaletteCatalog.of} catalogues it, offering every
 * public method it declares except the ones marked {@link Hidden}.
 *
 * <p>It was called {@code @Facade} until 2026-08-27 and read by an annotation processor at compile time. The
 * processor is gone and the catalog is built by reflection, which is why the retention is now
 * {@code RUNTIME}: the plugin reads this off its own live {@code Class} objects.
 *
 * <p>That change removed the one thing a name could restate: with reflection, members are <em>discovered</em>
 * rather than named, so nothing in a catalog can go stale against a rename. What stays compiler-checked is
 * the class list, because {@code PaletteCatalog.of(Mouse.class, …)} is written with class literals.
 *
 * <h2>Catalogued, and offered or not</h2>
 *
 * <p>There are two bits here, not three. A class carrying this annotation is <b>catalogued</b> — the editor
 * recognises a call into it, files it under this plugin, and can decide that {@code Point} in a bot's source
 * means this plugin's and not {@code java.awt}'s. Whether it is also <b>offered</b> in the insert menus is
 * the separate question {@link Hidden} answers on the type.
 *
 * <p>The predecessor spelled this as a three-valued {@code role} element — {@code MENU}, {@code HIDDEN} and
 * {@code VALUE} — where every consumer only ever read one bit of it and nothing distinguished the last two.
 * A value type carrying {@code @Palette} and {@code @Hidden} says the same thing more plainly, and being in
 * the recognition set is the truthful answer for it: a plugin's own value type <em>is</em> its API.
 *
 * <h2>Why every element is a {@code String}</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #category()} names a {@link com.botmaker.plugin.api.catalog.Category}, which is a record and
 * deliberately open — a plugin defines its own — so no closed element type could express it. An annotation
 * element's type must also be resolvable wherever the annotation is applied, and the interesting application
 * sites are in modules that depend on this one.
