 * each one open its own section would produce a bar whose shape depends on the install order — the same
 * failure the value vocabulary avoids by making the host merge, not the plugins.
 *
 * <p>The groups are named for <em>what a person is doing</em>, not for who contributes them, because that is
 * the only ordering a user can predict: set the project up, then author it, then run it.
