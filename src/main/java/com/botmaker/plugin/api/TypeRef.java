 * The declared type of a value slot, as the host resolved it.

 * classpath, not its own: the class an editor would be handed may be a different version of itself, or may
 * not be loadable in the host's JVM at all. So the type crosses as names, and {@link #is(Class)} compares
 * by fully-qualified name — which is the comparison that is actually true across two classloaders.
 *
 * <p>{@link #qualifiedName()} may be empty when the host could not resolve the type (an unresolved import,
 * a project that does not compile). {@link #simpleName()} is still populated in that case, and an editor
 * that keys off a simple name alone still fires — deliberately, since refusing to edit a value because the
 * rest of the file is broken is the worse failure.
