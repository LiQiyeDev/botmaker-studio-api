/**
 * One type a plugin catalogues, its category, and the members of it worth proposing — in the order the plugin
 * declared them, which is the order the menu shows.
 *
 * <p>The type is a real {@link Class} rather than a name, and that is load-bearing: it is what lets the editor
 * answer "does this plugin own this simple name?" — the deduction that decides whether {@code Point} in a
 * bot's source means the SDK's or {@code java.awt}'s — without a hand-mirrored list of fully-qualified names.
 *
 * <p><b>Present means curated.</b> A type in the catalog offers exactly the members it lists and nothing
 * else; a type absent from the catalog is not catalogued at all. An entry with an empty member list is
 * therefore a verdict rather than an omission — it is how an enum whose constants are the whole point, or a
 * type reached only as a variable, is catalogued for its identity without proposing any of its methods.
 *
 * <p><b>Catalogued and offered are two bits, not one.</b> Every entry here is catalogued; {@link #offered()}
 * says whether the insert menus also list it. Until 2026-08-27 this was a three-valued {@code FacadeRole}
 * whose third state ({@code VALUE}) nothing anywhere distinguished from its second.
 *
 * @param type     the class
 * @param category the group it is filed under
 * @param offered  whether the insert menus list it, or whether it is only recognised
 * @param icon     a menu glyph, or {@code null} for the editor's own fallback
 * @param label    what to show, or {@code null} for the class's simple name
 * @param members  the offered members, in declaration order
