/**
 * The contract a BotMaker Studio plugin compiles against.
 *
 * <h2>What is here, and what is deliberately not</h2>
 * Interfaces and records. No implementation, no Studio types, and no syntax tree: a plugin describes what it
 * offers ({@link com.botmaker.plugin.api.catalog.PaletteCatalog}) and how it edits a value
 * ({@link com.botmaker.plugin.api.SlotEditor}), and writes back Java source as text. The host's parser, its
 * project model and its UI internals are all on the other side of this line.
 *
 * <h2>The one dependency</h2>
 * JavaFX, because a slot editor returns a {@code javafx.scene.Node}. That pins the platform to JavaFX
 * permanently and was chosen over a UI-factory abstraction: the editors worth writing are bespoke, and a
 * factory able to express them would be larger than JavaFX. It is {@code provided}-scoped, so it never
 * reaches a generated bot's classpath.
 *
 * <h2>Compatibility</h2>
 * A bot's source can be rewritten when the SDK changes; a plugin's bytecode cannot be rewritten by anyone.
 * So this module changes far more slowly than the plugins that implement it: new members arrive as
 * {@code default} methods, and a plugin built against an older release keeps working until a Studio
 * <em>major</em> release explicitly refuses it.
