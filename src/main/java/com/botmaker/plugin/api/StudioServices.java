/**
 * The host facilities a plugin may use, and deliberately no more than that.
 *
 * <p><b>The test for adding one is that the host is the only possible source of it</b> — not that the host
 * happens to have written it first. Which project is open, what theme the user chose, which window owns a
 * dialog, and the overlay that goes over every window on the screen: a plugin cannot answer any of those, so
 * they are here. Everything else it can do for itself, because {@code botmaker-shared} is published and any
 * plugin may depend on it — enumerating monitors, windows and emulator instances, grabbing pixels from them,
 * reading a launcher's installed-game library — and because the files under {@link #resourcesDir()} are
 * ordinary files.
 *
 * <p><b>The rule this replaced, and why.</b> Until 2026-08-27 the test was "a real editor needed it", and it
 * grew an {@code Assets} service (the project's named pictures), a {@code Capture.SourceChoice} vocabulary and
 * a {@code Frame}/{@code Sample} pair — every one of them a concept belonging to the SDK's <em>own</em> API:
 * a named picture is {@code ImageTemplate}'s, a capture source is {@code CaptureSource}'s, a launcher is
 * {@code Game}'s. Putting them here let plugin #1 reach through the contract for its own vocabulary, which no
 * second plugin could do — the back door this module exists to close. They were deleted rather than
 * generalised, because generalising them would only have moved the same privilege behind a wider name.
