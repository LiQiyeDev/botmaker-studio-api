/**
 * A released SDK version, as an authoring caller names it.
 *
 * <p>Every {@link Authoring} entry point takes one of these as its <b>first</b> argument, and that is the
 * whole point of the type: the SDK is now the generator, and a generator must be told which era's rules to
 * apply. A bot pinning 1.1.0 opened by an editor bundling 1.4.0 gets 1.1.0's project shape, not 1.4.0's —
 * the inversion's rule, that anything touching bot code takes its answer from <em>the bot's</em> SDK
 * version, is enforced by making the version unforgettable at the call site rather than by hoping a caller
 * passes it.
 *
 * <h2>The parse is total</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #of(String)} returns {@link Optional#empty()} for a version this build has never heard of and
 * never throws — the repo's rule for a persisted closed set. Empty is a real answer with a real meaning:
 * <em>this bot pins an SDK newer than the one doing the reading</em>, which is exactly the case
 * {@link AuthoringUnsupported} exists to report to the user. A caller that swallows the empty and guesses
 * {@link #latest()} has silently promised a bot something its own jar cannot deliver.
 *
 * <p>The constants are in release order, so {@link #latest()} is the last one and comparison is
 * {@link Enum#compareTo ordinal} comparison. The wire string is the plain semver with <b>no leading
 * {@code v}</b> — the git tag carries the {@code v}; nothing inside the API does, matching
 * {@link com.botmaker.sdk.api.meta.Since} and {@link com.botmaker.sdk.api.meta.Replaces}.
