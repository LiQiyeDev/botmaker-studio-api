/**
 * One activity: a named unit of work the bot can be in, and the stub class the generator emits for it.
 *
 * <p>{@link #outcomes()} are the <em>extra</em> ways it can end. Every activity also has the one it does not
 * declare — {@link FlowEdgeModel#NEXT_OUTCOME}, "nothing special to report, carry on" — which is emitted as
 * the first constant of the activity's {@code Outcome} enum and is what a wire with no outcome names. That
 * is why {@link #allOutcomes()} leads with it rather than appending it.
 *
 * <p>There is a second undeclared outcome, {@link FlowEdgeModel#DISABLED_OUTCOME}, and it is deliberately
 * <em>not</em> in that list: it is a port the flow can be wired from, not a constant the activity can report.
 * {@link #flowPorts()} is the list that includes it, and the two methods exist separately so the generated
 * enum and the editor's ports can differ in the one place they must.
 *
 * <p>{@link #goHome()} and {@link #popupCheck()} are boxed because absent and {@code false} are different
 * answers: a file written before the field existed must take the project's default, not a silent "no". Both
 * default to {@code true} when absent, which is what every project written before them behaved as.
 *
 * <h2>{@link #id()} — what a rename is a rename of</h2>
 *
 * <p>The name is what the user types and what the stub class is called, so it is exactly the thing a rename
 * changes. Anything holding "which file is this activity's" across a rename therefore cannot key on it: a
 * host reconciling seed files would see one activity vanish and another appear, orphan the stub the user
 * wrote their {@code run()} body into, and hand them an empty one. The id is the identity that survives
 * that — never shown, never typed, and never derived from anything the user can edit.
 *
 * <p><b>Absent means the name, and nothing migrates a file to fix that.</b> It is what every project written
 * before this field behaved as, and it is the right default on both counts: it needs no rewrite of anybody's
 * stored file to add a field they cannot see, and it is <em>stable</em> — a default that invented a fresh
 * random id on each read would make every open look like a rename. An activity created by an editor that
 * knows about ids gets a real one, so a rename gains the better behaviour where somebody is actually
 * working, and degrades to what it always did everywhere else.
 *
 * @param name        the activity's name; also the stub class's name and its registry key
 * @param enabled     whether the flow may enter it at all
 * @param description a human-readable note; may be empty
 * @param outcomes    the declared outcomes, beyond the implicit one
 * @param goHome      whether the driver returns home before entering it
 * @param popupCheck  whether the driver dismisses popups before entering it
 * @param id          the stable identity a rename does not change; blank ⇒ {@code name}
