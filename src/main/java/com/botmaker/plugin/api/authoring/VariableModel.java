/**
 * One project variable: a named, typed value, and the field the generated {@code Parameters} class carries
 * for it.
 *
 * <p><b>Every variable belongs to the project, not to an activity.</b> A delay two activities both wait for
 * is one variable they both read, rather than a copy each. {@link #tag()} is what organises them for a
 * reader — a <em>view</em>, never a scope.
 *
 * <p><b>The value is text.</b> {@link #value()} is a list of strings: one entry for an ordinary variable, one
 * per item for a list-shaped one. One shape on disk means one reader and one writer, which is worth the
 * {@code ["90s"]} a duration reads as in the file. Turning that text into the Java literal the field is
 * initialised with is the emitter's job, and the emitter is the only thing that has to know how.
 *
 * <p><b>Plain data.</b> Unlike the editor's own variable record, nothing here normalises, clamps or
 * re-derives — a model handed to {@link Authoring} is written as given, and a model read back is what the
 * file said. Whatever coercion an editor wants belongs in the editor, where the user can see it happen.
 *
 * @param name        the generated field name; a valid Java identifier
 * @param type        what kind of value, and in what shape
 * @param value       the wire form of the current value
 * @param description a human-readable note explaining what it is for; may be empty
 * @param tag         the group it is filed under; blank means ungrouped
 * @param visibility  whether the bot's user is offered this at all
 * @param options     the declared set of values, for a shape that {@link ValueChoice#hasOptions has one}
 * @param bounds      the declared range, for a bounded number
 * @param group       the {@link com.botmaker.plugin.api.ParameterGroup} this is filed under — which plugin
 *                    owns it, and so which generated class it becomes a field of. Blank is the default
 *                    plugin's, which is what makes every project written before groups existed read back
 *                    correctly. Unlike {@link #tag()}, this <em>is</em> a scope: names are unique within a
 *                    group, not across the project.
