/**
 * Everything a bot project declares about itself: its activities, its variables, its flow, and the editor
 * chrome that hangs off them. This is {@code activities.json}, as a value.
 *
 * <h2>One file, one owner</h2>
 *
 * <p>Some of what is here the generator reads and emits from — the activities, the variables, the wiring.
 * The rest ({@link VariableModel#bounds()}, {@link VariableModel#visibility()}, {@link #presets()},
 * {@link FlowNodeModel#x()}) it stores and never interprets: it is an editor's business, not a bot's.
 *
 * <p>Splitting the file along that line was considered and rejected. Two files, each authoritative for half
 * of one model, is how two authors get created — and the whole point of the inversion is that the file
 * describing a bot has exactly one. So the SDK owns all of it, and the fields it does not understand travel
 * through it untouched.
 *
 * <h2>Plain data</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here validates. A flow may name an activity that does not exist, a preset may list one that was
 * deleted, a variable's value may sit outside its own bounds. That is on purpose: a model is the file, and a
 * file can say anything. Refusing belongs where a user is watching — in an editor, or in the generator when
 * it is asked to emit something it genuinely cannot.
 *
 * @param activities      the activity definitions
 * @param variables       every configured value the bot reads, project-wide
 * @param flow            the wiring; empty means "no chosen chain, use declaration order"
 * @param presets         named on/off selections of activities, saved by the user
 * @param goHomeByDefault whether a newly added activity starts with {@link ActivityModel#goHome()} ticked;
 *                        boxed for the same reason as that field — absent must mean {@code true}
